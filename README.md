# A C Programming Quiz Game with File System
It is a console-based quiz game developed in C programming that leverages file handling to enhance interactivity. The game reads questions, multiple-choice options, and correct answers from an external file (data.txt), making it easy to update or customize the quiz content.<br>
# Instructions for Playing
Players start by choosing to either begin the quiz or exit the program. Once the game starts, a series of questions is displayed one at a time, along with four answer options. The player enters their answer by selecting the corresponding option number. For every correct answer, the player's score increases by one, and the next question is presented. The game ends when the player gives an incorrect answer, and their final score is displayed.
# Technical Highlights and Features of the Project
This project showcases the use of file operations (fopen, fscanf, and fclose), conditional statements, and loops in C programming. It is an excellent demonstration of how basic programming concepts can be applied to create interactive applications.
